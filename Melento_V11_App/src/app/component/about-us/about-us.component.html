            <strong>Welcome to Food Delivery, The best choice for fast food delivery. From your favourite restaurants.</strong><br/>
            Retail food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery
            company delivers food to a customer. An order is typically made either through a restaurant or 
            grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. The delivered items can include
            entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. 
            The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are 
            closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters. Recently, online food delivery through 
            third-party companies has become a growing industry and caused a delivery revolution. 
            Nascent technologies, such as autonomous vehicles have also been used to complete deliveries.

            On the surface, restaurant mission and vision statements are just a sentence or two about why a business exists. 
            They can seem insignificant compared to the daily grind of attracting customers, serving delicious 
            food, and growing your restaurant.However, these mission statements are important. Defining your 
            restaurant’s mission, vision and values will help guide strategic decisions and can add significant 
            value to your business.

            <strong>The world eats is changing dramatically.</strong><br/> 
            A little under two decades ago, restaurant-quality meal delivery was still largely limited to foods
            such as pizza and Chinese. Nowadays, food delivery has become a global market worth more than 
            $150 billion, having more than tripled since 2017. In the United States, the market has more than 
            doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic, following healthy historical growth of 8 percent.

            The advent of appealing, user-friendly apps and tech-enabled driver networks, coupled with changing consumer expectations, has unlocked ready-to-eat food delivery as a major category. Lockdowns and physical-distancing requirements early on in the pandemic gave the category an enormous boost, with delivery becoming a lifeline for the hurting restaurant industry. Moving forward, it is poised to remain a permanent fixture in the dining landscape.
